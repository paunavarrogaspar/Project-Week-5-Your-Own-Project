## Project Description
For this project I have tried to figure out whether there is a relation between the searches related to a place and its tourism influxes.


## Questions & Hypotheses
The main hypothesis was that Google Trends data can be an accurate predictor of tourism influx to a certain place.


## Dataset
To elaborate this project, I used the datasets with the search trend for every word I considered significant and for every country that I had the data and then I used the tourism datasets provided by the governments of Madrid and the Balearic Ilands. After I obtained the data, I put it all together into two datamarts: one for each location. The datamarts are the documents that can be found on the data folder of the repository.


## Workflow
First, I downloaded the data for the search trends and the tourism influx. Afterwards, I cleaned all the documents and merged them into two datamarts. Later, I analyzed the correlation between all the variables of the two locations. To finish, I plotted the information and extracted my conclusions.

## Organization
My organization was based on following three steps:
 1) Brainstorming for a topic.
 2) Settling on one topic.
 3) Choosing the cases I wanted to focus on.
 4) Listing my data needs.
 5) Obtaining said data.
 6) Analyzing it.
 7) Writing the paper and preparing the presentation.
